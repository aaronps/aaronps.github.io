Rebar3 on the test suite has a rebar_localfs_resource which is what I wanted to use, I will make a plugin which makes the same (learned from it how to use rebar_file_utils:cp_r) and later make a localplugins plugin which will compile a set of files on a plugins folder and run its functions, the idea is that one file is one plugin.

==== Escriptize ====

Will load all files on the ./ebin folder and add it to the $app/ebin folder, the problem is, if you have multiple apps, will it add to multiple of them?

===== Notes =====

From `$project_base/_build/$profile/lib/*/ebin` only beams and app file will be copied to final destination
From `$project_base/ebin` all files will be copied to final destination

===== To research =====

* What is the difference between plugins and project_plugins?
* project plugins
	Projects and dependencies might use the same local plugin but with different versions
	When compile, use a different module_name for local plugins, as to avoid clash.


===== What is this? =====

//This section contains notes which I do not recal the meaning.//

Provider hooks (as defined when providers:create/1 is called, are not used by rebar.
