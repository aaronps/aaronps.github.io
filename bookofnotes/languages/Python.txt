====== Python ======
Created Wednesday 04 April 2018

Modify python search path with simple environment variables modification.

This works because python will always ''import site'' which the operating system should provide, what we do is override it to use our copy, run our initialization code and then reimport the global site module.

1. On your execution directory add file named ''site.py''
{{{code: lang="python" linenumbers="True"
import sys

# remove dot folder as in this case we are not using it anymore
sys.path.remove('.')
sys.path.insert(0, 'some/extra/path')

del sys.modules['site']
import site
}}}


2. Run with ''PYTHONPATH=.'':
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
# custom program
PYTHONPATH=. ./yourProgram

#the 
PYTHONPATH=. python
}}}
